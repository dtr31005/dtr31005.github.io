		<tr><td>	Lebron James. The King. The kid from Ohio. Lebron James is arguably one of the most talented athletes of all time. After viewing his track record in the NBA, this is unarguable. Three championships, 6 MVP's and countless highlight plays that bring crowds, both home and away, to their feet. Even when he came out of highschool he was a man among boys, standing at 6 foot 8. He towered over his fellow teammates while leading them to a high school national championship. Shortly after, he was drafted in 2003 by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the number one overall pick. <td> 	The Cleveland Cavaliers won their most recent championship in 2016 over the Golden State Warriors. The win took place over 7 straight games of hardfought basketball. The Cavaliers are currently attempting to return to the NBA Finals for the fourth consecutive year. They sure have a great chance, adding veterans Derrick Rose and Dwayne Wade into the mix over the off season. Even though they are off to a slow start, currently holding a record of 8-7, LeBron will most likely whip them into playoff form by the end of the regular season.

LeBron James has two sons, a daughter, and is happily married with his wife Savannah. His oldest son is already being scouted for college basketball because of his skills and some mix of his dad's legacy. LeBron has shown much interest in the world of showbusiness, already making cameos in multiple movies. It is rumored that he could star in Space Jam 2, the hypothetical sequel to the classic with Michael Jordan. On top of all his hobbies and interests, he was awarded the 16-17 J. Walter Kennedy Citizen Award as a result of his outreach to the community around him.
